Augmented Reality by combining real and virtual images, can help aspiring healthcare experts to understand human anatomy in a more precise and spectacular way. It enables the students to visualize and perceive every muscle and veins present in the human body in a 3D vision. In this way augmented reality can revolutionize medical education.

Augmented Reality magnifies the learning process. It can recreate or simulate certain conditions that help students to practice with virtual objects that resemble the human body and organ. It provides real life experiences that have low-risks, affordable, along with real-time feedback. Hence, AR is being integrated into healthcare education extensively.
